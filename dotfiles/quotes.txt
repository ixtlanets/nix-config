"All of us, whether or not we are warriors, have a cubic centimeter of chance that pops out in front of our eyes from time to time. The difference between the average person and a warrior is that the warrior is aware of this and stays alert, deliberately waiting, so that when this cubic centimeter of chance pops out, it is picked up." -- Carlos Castaneda
.
"All paths are the same, leading nowhere. Therefore, pick a path with heart!" -- Carlos Castaneda
.
"All paths are the same: they lead nowhere. However, a path without a heart is never enjoyable. On the other hand, a path with heart is easy-it does not make a warrior work at liking it; it makes for a joyful journey; as long as a man follows it, he is one with it." -- Carlos Castaneda
.
"A man of knowledge lives by acting, not by thinking about acting." -- Carlos Castaneda
.
"An average man is too concerned with liking people or with being liked himself. A warrior likes, that's all. He likes whatever or whomever he wants, for the hell of it." -- Carlos Castaneda
.
"A rule of thumb for a warrior is that he makes his decisions so carefully that nothing that may happen as a result of them can surprise him, much less drain his power." -- Carlos Castaneda
.
"A warrior acts as if he knows what he is doing, when in effect he knows nothing." -- Carlos Castaneda
.
"A warrior considers himself already dead, so there is nothing to lose. The worst has already happened to him, therefore he's clear and calm; judging him by his acts or by his words, one would never suspect that he has witnessed everything." -- Carlos Castaneda
.
"A warrior doesn't know remorse for anything he has done, because to isolate one's acts as being mean, or ugly, or evil is to place an unwarranted importance on the self." -- Carlos Castaneda
.
"A warrior lives by acting, not by thinking about acting, nor by thinking about what he will think when he has finished acting." -- Carlos Castaneda
.
"A warrior never worries about his fear." -- Carlos Castaneda
.
"A warrior seeks to act rather than talk." -- Carlos Castaneda
.
"A warrior takes responsibility for his acts, for the most trivial of acts. An average man acts out his thoughts, and never takes responsibility for what he does." -- Carlos Castaneda
.
"A warrior thinks of death when things become unclear. The idea of death is the only thing that tempers our spirit." -- Carlos Castaneda
.
"Being timid prevents us from examining and exploiting our lot as men" -- Carlos Castaneda
.
"Death never stops. Sometimes it turns off its lights, that's all." -- Carlos Castaneda
.
"Feeling important makes one heavy, clumsy, and vain." -- Carlos Castaneda
.
"Feeling important makes one heavy, clumsy and vain. To be a warrior one needs to be light and fluid." -- Carlos Castaneda
.
"For a warrior, to be inaccessible means that he touches the world around him sparingly. And above all, he deliberately avoids exhausting himself and others. He doesn't use and squeeze people until they have shriveled to nothing, especially the people he loves." -- Carlos Castaneda
.
"Fright never injures anyone. What injures the spirit is having someone always on your back, beating you, telling you what to do and what not to do." -- Carlos Castaneda
.
"I am only a man ... who knows that he'll never understand all that is around him." -- Carlos Castaneda
.
"If a warrior is to succeed at anything, the success must come gently, with a great deal of effort but with no stress or obsession." -- Carlos Castaneda
.
"If his spirit is distorted he should simply fix it—purge it, make it perfect—because there is no other task in our entire lives which is more worthwhile...To seek the perfection of the warrior's spirit is the only task worthy of our temporariness, our manhood." -- Carlos Castaneda
.
"Intent is not a thought, or an object, or a wish. Intent is what can make a man succeed when his thoughts tell him that he is defeated. It operates in spite of the warrior's indulgence. Intent is what makes him invulnerable. Intent is what sends a shaman through a wall, through space, to infinity." -- Carlos Castaneda
.
"It doesn't matter how one was brought up. What determines the way one does anything is personal power." -- Carlos Castaneda
.
"it's better to get something worthwhile done using deception than to fail to get something worthwhile done using truth." -- Carlos Castaneda
.
"I wanted to convince you that you must learn to make every act count, since you are going to be here for only a short while, in fact, too short for witnessing all the marvels of it." -- Carlos Castaneda
.
"Look at every path closely and deliberately, then ask ourselves this crucial question: Does this path have a heart? If it does, then the path is good. If it doesn't, it is of no use." -- Carlos Castaneda
.
"My laughter ... is real, but it is also controlled folly because it is useless; it changes nothing and yet I still choose to do it. ... I am happy because I choose to look at things that make me happy..." -- Carlos Castaneda
.
"Nothing in this world is a gift. Whatever must be learned must be learned the hard way." -- Carlos Castaneda
.
"Once a man worries, he clings to anything out of desperation; and once he clings he is bound to get exhausted or to exhaust whomever or whatever he is clinging to. A warrior-hunter, on the other hand, knows he will lure game into his traps over and over again, so he doesn't worry." -- Carlos Castaneda
.
"Only as a warrior can one withstand the path of knowledge. A warrior cannot complain or regret anything. His life is an endless challenge, and challenges cannot possibly be good or bad. Challenges are simply challenges." -- Carlos Castaneda
.
"Only the idea of death makes a warrior sufficiently detached so that he is capable of abandoning himself to anything. He knows his death is stalking him and won't give him time to cling to anything so he tries, without craving, all of everything." -- Carlos Castaneda
.
"Personal history must be constantly renewed by telling parents, relatives, and friends everything one does. On the other hand, for the warrior who has no personal history, no explanations are needed; nobody is angry or disillusioned with his acts. And above all, no one pins him down with their thoughts and their expectations." -- Carlos Castaneda
.
"Sometimes the road less traveled is less traveled for a reason" -- Carlos Castaneda
.
"That is the misfortune of human beings. None of us have sufficient time, and your continuity has no meaning in this awesome, mysterious world." -- Carlos Castaneda
.
"The basic difference between an ordinary man and a warrior is that a warrior takes everything as a challenge, while an ordinary man takes everything as a blessing or a curse." -- Carlos Castaneda
.
"The hardest thing in the world is to assume the mood of a warrior. It is of no use to be sad and complain and feel justified in doing so, believing that someone is always doing something it us. Nobody is doing anything to anybody, much less to a warrior." -- Carlos Castaneda
.
"The internal dialogue is what grounds people in the daily world. The world is such and such or so and so, only because we talk to ourselves about its being such and such and so and so. The passageway into the world of shamans opens up after the warrior has learned to shut off his internal dialogue." -- Carlos Castaneda
.
"The only thing that is real is the being in you that is going to die." -- Carlos Castaneda
.
"There are lots of things a warrior can do at a certain time which he couldn't do years before. Those things themselves did not change; what changed was his idea of himself." -- Carlos Castaneda
.
"There are worlds upon worlds, right here in front of us. And they are nothing to laugh at." -- Carlos Castaneda
.
"There's no emptiness in the life of a warrior. Everything is filled to the brim. Everything is filled to the brim, and everything is equal." -- Carlos Castaneda
.
"The self-confidence of the warrior is not the self-confidence of the average man. The average man seeks certainty in the eyes of the onlooker and calls that self-confidence. The warrior seeks impeccability in his own eyes and calls that humbleness. The average man is hooked to his fellow men, while the warrior is hooked only to infinity." -- Carlos Castaneda
.
"The spirit of a warrior is not geared to indulging and complaining, nor is it geared to winning or losing. The spirit of a warrior is geared only to struggle, and every struggle is a warrior's last battle on earth. Thus the outcome matters very little to him. In his last battle on earth a warrior lets his spirit flow free and clear. And as he wages his battle, knowing that his intent is impeccable, a warrior laughs and laughs." -- Carlos Castaneda
.
"The trick is in what one emphasizes. We either make ourselves miserable, or we make ourselves happy. The amount of work is the same." -- Carlos Castaneda
.
"The world around us is a mystery, and men are no better than anything else." -- Carlos Castaneda
.
"The world is a mystery. This, what you're looking at, is not all there is to it. There is much more to the world, so much more, in fact, that it is endless. So when you're trying to figure it out, all you're really doing is trying to make the world familiar. You and I are right here, in the world that you call real, simply because we both know it." -- Carlos Castaneda
.
"The world is incomprehensible. We won't ever understand it; we won't ever unravel its secrets. Thus we must treat the world as it is: a sheer mystery." -- Carlos Castaneda
.
"To achieve the mood of a warrior is not a simple matter. It is a revolution. To regard the lion and the water rats and our fellow men as equals is a magnificent act of a warrior's spirit. It takes power to do that." -- Carlos Castaneda
.
"To be a warrior is not a simple matter of wishing to be one. It is rather an endless struggle that will go on to the very last moment of our lives. Nobody is born a warrior, in exactly the same way that nobody is born an average man. We make ourselves into one or the other." -- Carlos Castaneda
.
"To believe the world is only as you think it is, is stupid." -- Carlos Castaneda
.
"Warriors do not win victories by beating their heads against walls, but by overtaking the walls. Warriors jump over walls; they don't demolish them." -- Carlos Castaneda
.
"We either make ourselves happy or miserable. The amount of work is the same." -- Carlos Castaneda
.
"We hardly ever realize that we can cut anything out of our lives, anytime, in the blink of an eye." -- Carlos Castaneda
.
"When a man has fulfilled all four of these requisites-to be wide awake, to have fear, respect, and absolute assurance-there are no mistakes for which he will have to account; under such conditions his actions lose the blundering quality of the acts of a fool. If such a man fails, or suffers a defeat, he will have lost only a battle, and there will be no pitiful regrets over that." -- Carlos Castaneda
.
"When a warrior learns to stop the internal dialogue, everything becomes possible; the most far-fetched schemes become attainable." -- Carlos Castaneda
.
"The aim is to balance the terror of being alive with the wonder of being alive." -- Carlos Castaneda
.
"Self-importance requires spending most of one's life offended by something or someone." -- Carlos Castaneda
.
"To ask the right question is already half the solution of a problem." -- Carlos Castaneda
.
"Happiness is an attitude. We either make ourselves miserable, or happy and strong. The amount of work is the same." -- Carlos Castaneda
.
"Hunting power is a strange affair. One must be artful to approach power as one would a skittish horse, matching its pace until it allows us to ride it." -- Carlos Castaneda
.
"A separate reality begins when we decide to snatch it from the middle of ordinary affairs." -- Carlos Castaneda
.
"Knowledge is not a mere collection of facts, but a journey through the mystery of the universe." -- Carlos Castaneda
.

.
"Seeing is not a gift but a power that one has to reclaim through effort." -- Carlos Castaneda
.
"Silence is the only true friend that shall never betray you." -- Carlos Castaneda
.
"To be a warrior means to be humble and alert." -- Carlos Castaneda
.
"The path of knowledge is a forced one. In order to learn we must be spurred." -- Carlos Castaneda
.
"The world is unfathomable. So we must be as unfathomable as it is, to be in it." -- Carlos Castaneda
.
"We are men and our lot in life is to learn and to be hurled into inconceivable new worlds." -- Carlos Castaneda
.
"A warrior lives by his word. His word is his commitment and his bond." -- Carlos Castaneda
.
"Power rests on the kind of knowledge one holds. What is the sense of knowing things that are useless?" -- Carlos Castaneda
.
"The art of being a warrior is to balance the wonder and the terror of being alive." -- Carlos Castaneda
.
"Every warrior must learn that the heart of his struggle is to balance between action and patience." -- Carlos Castaneda
.
"The path without a heart will turn against men and destroy them. It does not take much to die, and to seek death is to seek nothing." -- Carlos Castaneda
.
"For the warrior, there are no ends, only means." -- Carlos Castaneda
.
"You must live in the present, launch yourself on every wave, find your eternity in each moment." -- Henry David Thoreau

.
"Waste no more time arguing what a good man should be. Be One." –- Marcus Aurelius

.
"It never ceases to amaze me: we all love ourselves more than other people, but care more about their opinion than our own." -- Marcus Aurelius

.
"The chief task in life is simply this: to identify and separate matters so that I can say clearly to myself which are externals not under my control, and which have to do with the choices I actually control.
